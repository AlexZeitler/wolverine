Hey, it's a complicated world and Wolverine is a relative newcomer, so it's somewhat likely you'll find yourself needing to make a Wolverine application talk via Rabbit MQ to 
a non-Wolverine application. Not to worry (too much), Wolverine has you covered with the ability to customize Wolverine to Azure Service Bus mapping and some built in recipes for 
interoperability with commonly used .NET messaging frameworks.

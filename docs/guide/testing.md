# Test Automation Support

The Wolverine absolutely believes in Test Driven Development and the importance of strong test automation strategies as a key part of sustainable development. To that end,
Wolverine's conceptual design from the very beginning (Wolverine started as "Jasper" in 2015!) has been to maximize testability by trying
to decouple application code from framework or other infrastructure concerns.

See Jeremy's blog post [How Wolverine allows for easier testing](https://jeremydmiller.com/2022/12/13/how-wolverine-allows-for-easier-testing/) for an introduction to unit testing Wolverine message handlers.

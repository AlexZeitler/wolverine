# ASP.Net Core Integration

::: tip
Wolverine.HTTP is an alternative to Minimal API or MVC Core for crafting HTTP service endpoints, but absolutely tries to be a good citizen within the greater
ASP.Net Core ecosystem and heavily utilizes much of the ASP.Net Core technical foundation.
:::

The `WolverineFx.HTTP` library extends Wolverine's runtime model to writing HTTP services with ASP.Net Core. As a quick sample, start
a new project with:

```bash
dotnet new webapi
```

Then add the `WolverineFx.HTTP` dependency with:

```bash
dotnet add
```

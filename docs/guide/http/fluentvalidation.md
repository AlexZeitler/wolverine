# Fluent Validation Middleware for HTTP

Wolverine.Http has a separate package called `WolverineFx.Http.FluentValidation` that provides a simple middleware
for using [Fluent Validation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/) in your HTTP endpoints.

To get started, install that Nuget reference:

```bash
dotnet add package WolverineFx.Http.FluentValidation
```

Next, let's assume that you have some Fluent Validation validators registered in your application container for the
request types of your HTTP endpoints -- and the [UseFluentValidation](/guide/handlers/fluent-validation) method from the 
`WolverineFx.FluentValidation` package will help find these validators and register them in a way that optimizes this
middleware usage.

Next, add this one single line of code to your Wolverine.Http bootstrapping:

```csharp
opts.UseFluentValidationProblemDetailMiddleware();
```

as shown in context below in an application shown below:

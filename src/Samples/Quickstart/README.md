# Quickstart

This is a very simple project just showing the usage of Wolverine in an ASP.Net Core project. To run the project,
just run the project from Rider/Visual Studio.Net/VS Code or even the command line, and it should pop a browser up
to the Swashbuckle page at [http://localhost:5048/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:5215/swagger/index.html) where
you can execute the endpoints.
